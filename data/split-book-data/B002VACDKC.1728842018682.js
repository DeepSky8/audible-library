window.bookSummaryJSON = "Over 400 years before Columbus \"discovered\" the New World, it is believed that someone else already had - Icelander Bjarni Herjolfsson. Over the years 985-986, Herjolfsson was attempting to reach Eirik the Red's colony on Greenland when he was blown off-course. He sighted a coastline covered with woods, and thus was the first to glimpse a piece of North America. This fascinating collection includes the complete \"Greenlanders' Saga\" and \"Eirik the Red's Saga,\" as well as selections from \"The Book of the Icelander\" and \"The Book of the Settlements.\" Also included are commentaries on sailing techniques, and historical and cultural background.";
