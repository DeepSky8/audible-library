His friends - Max, Lucy, and Henry - are impressed and want to join their friend on a journey to the island. Yet not everyone is happy: Steve's neighbor, Kyra, is upset because she wasn't chosen as a contestant. </p> <p>Steve asks Kyra to come to the competition and help the gang build boats to get to Mushroom Island. She agrees, and the group sets out on an adventure to the contest. Getting there is half the fun, and the group treks through the jungle, where they find a rare temple filled with treasure! But getting the treasure isn't easy, and they have to fight fierce battles to continue their journey. </p> <p>After their exhilarating and rewarding journey to the contest, they finally make their way onto the island and meet the judges as well as the other four contestants, whose egos are as big as the houses they are building.
