window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This collection of 25 Hercule Poirot adventures is compiled from short stories written by Agatha Christie for <i>The Sketch</i> magazine in 1923 from March to December. In these stories, including \"The Disappearance of Mr. Davenheim\", \"The Veiled Lady\", and \"The Adventure of the Egyptian Tomb\", the eccentric private detective slowly and surely solves mysteries involving jealousy, revenge, and greed. These stories were well-received at the time and cemented Christie's reputation as the worthy successor to Arthur Conan Doyle.</p>";
