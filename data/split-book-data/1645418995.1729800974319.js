window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the aftermath of the cold-blooded assassinations that killed her parents and shattered the Vatta intersteller shipping empire, Kylara Vatta sets out to avenge the killings and salvage the family business. Ky soon discovers a conspiracy of terrifying scope, breathtaking audacity, and utter ruthlessness. The only hope against such powerful evil is for all the space merchants to band together. Unfortunately, because she commands a ship that once belonged to a notorious pirate, Ky is met with suspicion, if not outright hostility...even from her own cousin. Before she can take the fight to the enemy, Kylara must survive a deadly minefield of deception and betrayal.</p> <p>Performed by Nanette Savard, Lily Beacon, Christopher Scheeren, Colleen Delany, Ken Jackson, Mort Shelby, Jeff Baker, Steven Carpenter, Elizabeth Jernigan, David Coyne, Christopher Graybill, Richard Rohan, Tim Getman, Barbara Pinolini, Terence Aselford, Michael Glenn, Andy Clemence, Eric Messner, Yasmin Tuazon, Dylan Lynch, Sherri Simpson, James Lewis, Thomas Penny, Laura Quinn, Kate Foster, Danny Gavigan, Joe Brack, James Konicek, Johann Dettweiler, Nathanial Perry.</p>";
