window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Who is Casia Greythorne?</p> <p>Still reeling from an unimaginable loss and the revelation of an identity she isn't sure she wants to embrace, Casia has one plan: Try to control the strange magic awakening inside of her. Mastering that magic will take her and her friends on a quest through cursed lands, into the dwellings of old gods, and deep into a Southern empire filled with deadly foes and unlikely allies.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the foundations of the Kethran Empire continue to crumble. The king-emperor clings to his crown with increasingly bloodied hands. Monsters and soldiers alike stalk Casia's every step, determined not to let her return to claim a throne that is rightfully hers. Still, the greatest threat to her possible rule may not lie in the king-emperor, but in a former captain of his army - a man with whom she came dangerously close to falling in love.</p> <p>Elander Revenmar thought he knew who he was. He had a mission, a plan, a god he was content to serve. Then came Casia. A woman as mysterious as she is dangerous. One he should have stayed away from and whose life he never should have saved.</p> <p>Because salvation always comes with a cost.</p> <p>And some debts can only be paid for in blood.</p>";
