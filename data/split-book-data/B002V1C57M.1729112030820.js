window.bookSummaryJSON = "The Five Little Peppers are an adorable family of children growing up in a small town and cared for by their widowed mother. She is so poor that the pittance she earns as the town seamstress fails to support or even sustain the family. <p> Everything happens to this brood while mother is away sewing, but no matter how dangerous the situation, they come out of it safe and smiling. The children are happy despite their poverty, and the smallest pleasures cause delight and merriment in the little house. When the eldest daughter is offered a chance to be adopted by a rich family, she chooses to return to her poor but happy home.</p>";
