window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this unusual recording, the talented actor Frank Muller reads Shakespeare's complete work with all stage directions, in the tradition of actors/managers/authors auditioning plays for their companies. Muller's interpretation allows us to listen directly to the author's voice, without extraneous distractions. He brings to life the story of Hamlet, the complex tragic hero bent on avenging his father's murder yet racked by uncertainty brought on by the strength and eloquence of his own conscience. </p>";
