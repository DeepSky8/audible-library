window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Nineteen-year-old Greg Sestero met Tommy Wiseau at an acting school in San Francisco. Wiseau's scenes were rivetingly wrong, yet Sestero, hypnotized by such uninhibited acting, thought, \"I have to do a scene with this guy.\" That impulse changed both of their lives. Wiseau seemed never to have read the rule book on interpersonal relationships (or the instructions on a bottle of black hair dye), yet he generously offered to put the aspiring actor up in his LA apartment. Sestero's nascent acting career first sizzled, then fizzled, resulting in Wiseau's last-second offer to Sestero of co-starring with him in <i>The Room</i>, a movie Wiseau wrote and planned to finance, produce, and direct - in the parking lot of a Hollywood equipment-rental shop. </p> <p>Wiseau spent $6 million of his own money on his film, but despite the efforts of the disbelieving (and frequently fired) crew and embarrassed (and frequently fired) actors, the movie made no sense. Nevertheless, Wiseau rented a Hollywood billboard featuring his alarming headshot and staged a red carpet premiere. <i>The Room</i> made $1,800 at the box office and closed after two weeks. One reviewer said that watching <i>The Room</i> was like \"getting stabbed in the head\". </p> <p><i>The Disaster Artist</i> is Greg Sestero's laugh-out-loud funny account of how Tommy Wiseau defied every law of artistry, business, and friendship to make \"the <i>Citizen Kane</i> of bad movies\" (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>), which is now an international phenomenon, with Wiseau himself beloved as an oddball celebrity. Written with award-winning journalist Tom Bissell, <i>The Disaster Artist</i> is an inspiring tour de force, an open-hearted portrait of an enigmatic man who will improbably capture your heart.</p>";
