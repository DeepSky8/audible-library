window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>If the Roaring Twenties are remembered as the era of \"flaming youth\", it was F. Scott Fitzgerald who lit the fire. His semiautobiographical first novel, <i>This Side of Paradise</i>, became an instant best seller and established an image of seemingly carefree, party-mad young men and women out to create a new morality for a new, post-war America. It traces the early life of Amory Blaine from the end of prep school through Princeton to the start of an uncertain career in New York City. </p> <p>Alternately self-confident and self-effacing, torn between ambition and idleness, the self-absorbed, immature Amory yearns to run with Princeton's rich, fast crowd and become one of the \"gods\" of the campus. Hopelessly romantic, he learns about love and sex from a series of beautiful young \"flappers\", women who leave him both exhilarated and devastated.</p> <p>Fitzgerald describes it all in intensely lyrical prose that fills the novel with a heartbreaking sense of longing, as Amory comes to understand that the sweet-scented springtime of his life is fragile and fleeting, disappearing into memory even as he reaches for it.</p>";
