window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Young Huck is an industrious, fiercely independent boy who escapes his abusive, drunken father and sets out on an unforgettable journey down the Mississippi River. Enjoying his freedom, he befriends a kindhearted slave named Jim, whose suffering teaches Huck powerful lessons about racism, personal liberty, and the complexities of life. Revolutionary for its realistic dialogue and uncompromising plot, <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> is arguably the greatest of all American novels, and a powerful sequel to Mark Twain's lighthearted classic, <i>Tom Sawyer</i>.</p>";
