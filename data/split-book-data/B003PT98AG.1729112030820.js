window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In <i>The Sword of Bedwyr</i>, young Luthien Bedwyr rebelled against the crushing rule of Wizard-King Greensparrow and his cruel wizard-lords. To save his once proud land of Eriador, Luthien was given a magical cape that renders its wearer invisible but leaves behind an indelible scarlet silhouette. In <i>Luthien's Gamble</i>, we see Luthien at a crossroads: in spite of the urgings of his comrades to avoid further conflict with Greensparrow, Luthien feels compelled to continue the battle for his beloved country Eriador. </p> <p>Realizing that nobody else will take charge, and with the support of both dwarves and elves, Luthien and his followers stage guerilla raids on town after town. Luthien and his forces defeat scores of enemies and win huge numbers of allies. In the end, King Greensparrow sues for peace. Yet Luthien and Brind'Amour recognize that even in this time of celebration, Greensparrow cannot be trusted, and that the rumblings of a larger battle - for the freedom of the known world - loom in the not-too-distant future.</p>";
