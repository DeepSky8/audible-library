window.bookSummaryJSON = "For the first time in Jack Aubrey's long, illustrious career, the sea, to which he had escaped with very little more than his dignity in tact, brings small solace to him because of his increasing despondency over debts and troubles at home. <p>Shoved into a temporary command in \"that rotten old <i>Worcester</i>,\" Aubrey is off to the Mediterranean to join the Royal Navy's blockade of the French port of Toulon, where he will be dispatched by Admiral Harte (unfortunately the same Admiral Harte he cuckolded years ago) on a secret mission that promises to embroil Aubrey in political conflict. His friend Stephen's help notwithstanding, Aubrey faces some of the choppiest waters of his career.</p> <p>This is the eighth book in O'Brian's 20-volume Aubrey/Maturin series.</p>";
