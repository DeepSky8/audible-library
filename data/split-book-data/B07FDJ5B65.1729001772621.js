window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>On the long roads of Deverry ride two mercenaries whose fates lie hidden deep in that of their own land. But Lord Rhodry, exiled from the dragon court of Aberwyn, has yet to discover his true parentage, and his swordmaster-lover, Jill, has barely glimpsed her awesome powers. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the ancient sorcerer Nevyn, held back by his vows from boldly intervening in their lives, can only watch and wait as Rhodry and Jill move ever closer to danger. For as the two struggle to recover the Great Stone, the mystic jewel that guides the conscience of the kingship of Deverry, malevolent dark masters are weaving terrifying spells against them - and displacing messengers of death. </p> <p>Katharine Kerr has extensively rewritten <i>Darkspell</i>, incorporating major changes in the text, making this her definitive edition. Here the epic saga that began with <i>Daggerspell </i>continues - a tale of might and magic, lust and glory, dark danger, and poignant desires that echo from Deverry's sapphire waters to its secret mountain caverns. It's a spellbinding story destined to please fantasy lovers everywhere.</p>";
