One such man is Milan Rados, a former Serbian paramilitary commander wanted for war crimes and now head of an organized criminal network in Belgrade. He has escaped justice once already, so it's Victor's job to take the justice to him. </p> <p><b>It's how soon they'll die.</b> </p> <p>Victor might be the best in the business, but with powerful friends and an entire crew to protect him, Rados is a hard man to corner and even harder to kill. To get close to his target, Victor will need more than his deadly skills. An unlikely ally can provide him with the edge he seeks, but there's a price on Victor's head - and a killer who won't quit knows just how to find him.... </p>";
