window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Even as a young girl, Jill was a favorite of the magical, mysterious Wildfolk, who appeared to her from their invisible realm. Little did she know her extraordinary friends represented but a glimpse of a forgotten past and a fateful future. Four hundred years - and many lifetimes ago - one selfish young lord caused the death of two innocent lovers. Then and there he vowed never to rest until he'd righted that wrong - and laid the foundation for the lives of Jill and all those whom she would hold dear: her father, the mercenary soldier Cullyn; the exiled berserker Rhodry Maelwaedd; and the ancient and powerful herbman Nevyn, all bound in a struggle against darkness...and a quest to fulfill the destinies determined centuries ago. </p> <p>Here in this newly revised edition is the incredible novel that began one of the best-loved fantasy series in recent years - a tale of bold adventure and timeless love, perilous battle, and pure magic. For long-standing fans of Deverry and those who have yet to experience this exciting series, <i>Daggerspell</i> is a rare and special treat.</p>";
