window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Brought to you by Penguin.</b><br> <br> The audiobook of <i>Pyramids</i> is narrated by Alfred Enoch, known for playing Dean Thomas in the Harry Potter film series, and Wes Gibbins in <i>How To Get Away With Murder</i>. BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>; <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>; <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (<i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i>; <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.<br> <br> <b>'\"LOOK AFTER THE DEAD,\" SAID THE PRIESTS, \"AND THE DEAD WOULD LOOK AFTER YOU.\"'</b><br> <br> Young Prince Teppic is sent far away from his desert homeland to the city of Ankh-Morpork for the best education money can buy. Which just so happens to be at the Assassins' Guild.<br> <br> But when Teppic's father dies suddenly, fate takes him away from assassination to something far more unsavoury: politics. Teppic returns home to the small, penniless kingdom of Djelibeybi to take his place as ruler.<br> <br> It isn't easy, being a teenage pharaoh. As tradition dictates, the new king must build a monumental pyramid to honour his dead father. But this one might just bankrupt the kingdom, and warp the very fabric of time and space itself...<br> <br> The Discworld novels can be read in any order but<i> Pyramids</i> is a standalone.<br> <br> The first book in the Discworld series - <i>The Colour of Magic</i> - was published in 1983. Some elements of the Discworld universe may reflect this.</p>";
