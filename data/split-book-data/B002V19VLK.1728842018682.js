window.bookSummaryJSON = "In <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>, the narrator represents himself as a reliable reporter of the fantastic adventures he has just experienced. But how far can we rely on a narrator who has been impersonated by someone else? The work purports to be a travel book, and describes the shipwrecked Gulliver's encounters with the inhabitants of four extraordinary places: Lilliput, Brobdingnag, Laputa, and the country of the Houyhnhnms. A consumately skillful blend of fantasy and realism makes <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> by turns hilarious, frightening, and profound. This is one of literature's most disturbing satires on the human condition.";
