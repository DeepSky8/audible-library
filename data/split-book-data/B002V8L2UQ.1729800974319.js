window.bookSummaryJSON = "In the first sequel to <i>Anne of Green Gables</i>, Lucy Montgomery's feisty red-headed heroine is now 16 and a school teacher in the small village of Avonlea on Prince Edward Island. Although older, she isn't necessarily wiser, and she hasn't outgrown her mischievous antics. She learns how complicated life can be when she takes two new orphans at Green Gables under her wings, meddles in someone else's love life, and learns about romance herself when she encounters the \"odd behavior\" of a very handsome man, Gilbert Blythe.";
