Call it my witchy instincts, but I'm convinced something is seriously off with the guy. So how do I prove it to my aunt?</p> <p>The pressure is on as I only have four days to figure it out before the wedding—yes, four days until Beverly says, \"I do\" to that slimy bastard.</p> <p>As the clues start to come together, I have to wade through a pack of lies to get to the truth and find out who Derrick Baudelaire really is—and what he's hiding.</p> <p>But then the worst happens. While I'm trying to uncover Derrick's dark secrets, Lilith comes calling. She's ready to set her plan in motion. Her plan to kill her husband, a.k.a. Lucifer, the king of hell. And I'm her secret weapon.</p> <p>Trouble is, this time, I might not make it back alive.</p>";
