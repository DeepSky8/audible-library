window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Brought to you by Penguin.</b></p> <p>The audiobook of <i>Feet of Clay</i> is narrated by impressionist and actor Jon Culshaw, best known for BBC Radio 4’s <i>Dead Ringers</i>, and for the Doctor Who audiobooks and dramas. BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>; <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>; <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (<i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i>; <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.</p> <p><b>'IT WASN'T BY ELIMINATING THE IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU GOT AT THE TRUTH, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE; IT WAS BY THE MUCH HARDER PROCESS OF ELIMINATING THE POSSIBILITIES.'</b><br> <br> Commander Sam Vimes of the City Watch is used to trouble. There's <i>always</i> trouble in Ankh-Morpork.<br> <br> But this is new: people are being brutally murdered and there's no evidence of anything<i> alive</i> having been at the crime scene. At the same time, the most powerful man in the city has been poisoned and is clinging on to life by a thread.<br> <br> It's a conundrum of a case. With the help of Captain Carrot, the only watchman who knows the law inside-out; Corporal Cheery Littlebottom, an unconventional dwarf with an eye for forensics; and Constable Angua, a werewolf with an <i>excellent</i> sense of smell, Vimes tries to solve the mystery.<br> <br> But time is of the essence, for something extremely dangerous is loose in the city, its red eyes glowing in the night…</p> <p><i>Feet of Clay</i><b><i> </i></b>is the third book in the City Watch series, but you can listen to the Discworld novels in any order.<br> <br> The first book in the Discworld series - <i>The Colour of Magic</i> - was published in 1983. Some elements of the Discworld universe may reflect this.</p>";
