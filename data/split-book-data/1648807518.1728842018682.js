window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Esmay Suiza and Brun Meager should be friends - they're both bright, brave, likable and adventurous. But true friendship doesn't run any smoother than true love. Brun thinks Esmay's a stuck-up prig, and Esmay thinks Brun's a spoiled rich brat who's making a play for Barin Serrano, Esmay's first love. </p> <p>So when Brun falls into the hands of a repressive religious militia movement, Esmay finds herself n disgrace, suspected of conniving at the capture. Even Barin, now being pursued by the beautiful and ambitious Casea Ferradi, has turned against her, and Brun's powerful family doesn't want Esmay anywhere near the rescue attempt.</p> <p>Performed by Nanette Savard, Elisabeth Demery, Sunny Lasskey, Peter Stray, Jeff Baker, Thomas Penny, James Konicek, Mort Shelby, Jonathan Watkins, Tim Getman, James Lewis, Andy Clemence, David Coyne, Michael Glenn, Tom Simpson, MB Van Dorn, Richard Rohan, Christopher Graybill, Colleen Delany, Tim Carlin, Ken Jackson, Steven Carpenter, Lily Beacon, Elizabeth Jernigan, Dylan Lynch, Scott McCormick, Terence Aselford, Sherri Simpson, Karen Carbone, Bobby Aselford.</p>";
