window.bookSummaryJSON = "The Hugo Award-winning author of numerous best-sellers, Charles Stross crafts tales that push the limits of the genre. <p> In <i>Saturn's Children</i>, Freya is an obsolete android concubine in a society where humans haven't existed for hundreds of years. A rigid caste system keeps the Aristos, a vindictive group of humanoids, well in control of the lower, slave-chipped classes. So when Freya offends one particularly nasty Aristo, she's forced to take a dangerous courier job off-planet.</p>";
