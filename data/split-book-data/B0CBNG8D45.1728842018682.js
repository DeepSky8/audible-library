Their impossible aerobatics were bad enoughâ€”but then they started shooting at each other, and at the Navy, with nukes. Little ones at first, but winding up with a 500 megatonner at 90 miles that fried every piece of electronics within line-of-sight.</p> <p>Richard Ashton thought he was just a ringside observer of these now over-the-horizon events.

Suddenly he has his hands full of an unconscious, critically wounded, and impossibly human alien warrior who also happens to be a gorgeous female.</p> <p>That's when things got interesting.</p>";
