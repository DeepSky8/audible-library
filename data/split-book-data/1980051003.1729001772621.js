Now the fuel that powers the \"changed\" world is up for grabs in an orbiting spacecraft. With only days to plan, rough and ready paladin Herzer Herrick must assemble a team of expert warriors capable of both seat-of-the-pants engineering and hand-to-hand combat in space. In the meantime, Herzer must face his own demons as he waits for his emotionally-scarred fiancé to recover and finally bed him. And if that's not enough, there's a horde of \"changed\" orcs and goblins who are intent on delivering the power above to their totalitarian masters below. This is one space race free humanity cannot afford to lose! </p> <p>Multiple <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> best seller John Ringo delivers another rousing entry in his Council Wars saga!</p>";
