window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In an alternate America that runs on magic, a potential environmental disaster plunges an overworked bureaucrat into a deadly conspiracy of evil gods and darkest sorcery.</p> <p>David Fisher pushes paper for the EPA in a world that's a lot like ours...only different. In this California - and throughout the alternate United States - all gods are real, science doesn't exist, and magic rules everything, running imp-driven computers and creating anxiety-inducing bumper-to-bumper flying-carpet rush hours. Unfortunately, unchecked magic use can leave dangerous residues, creating hours of mind-numbing deskwork for David and his fellow bureaucrats at the Environmental Perfection Agency. Now a leakage at a toxic spell dump in Angels City is about to complicate David's life in ways he never imagined, unleashing vampires, werewolves, and soulless babies. Even the actual spooks at the CIA are concerned. But looking too closely into what might be more than just an accident could have David stepping on the toes of some very nasty deities indeed, imperiling his future on the Other Side...and on this one, as well. </p> <p>When it comes to creating alternate histories - and worlds - no one does it better than the great Harry Turtledove. The multiple-award-winning master of the fantastic carries listeners on a droll thrill ride through a richly detailed, ingeniously imagined fantasy reality where the impossible is mundane - and absolutely anything can happen.</p>";
