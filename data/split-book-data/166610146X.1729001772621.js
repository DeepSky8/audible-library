window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Beware the Moon of Three Rings.</b></p> <p>It was the time of the Moon of the Three Rings when the Free Trader ship <i>Lydis</i> landed on the planet Yiktor and junior crew member Krip Vorlund visited a beast show. He was strangely attracted to the owner of the show animals, a delicate and mysterious woman named Maelen. Soon Krip was caught in a vicious struggle by powerful opponents over the fate of Yiktor - and he learned the nature of Maelen's sorcery when he found his mind trapped in the body of a wolf-like creature.</p> <p>Krip would again inhabit a human body - though not his own - and on a second planet, Thoth, he and the crew of the Lydis would be drawn into a battle between ancient powers and nameless evil. Only Maelen the Moon Singer could save them with her superhuman powers - if she didn't bring death and destruction instead....</p>";
