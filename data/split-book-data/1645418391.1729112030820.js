window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Skull Throne of Krasia stands empty.</p> <p>Built from the skulls of fallen generals and demon princes, it is a seat of honor and ancient, powerful magic, keeping the demon corelings at bay. From atop the throne, Ahmann Jardir was meant to conquer the known world, forging its isolated peoples into a unified army to rise up and end the demon war once and for all.</p> <p>But Arlen Bales, the Warded Man, stood against this course, challenging Jardir to a duel he could not in honor refuse. Rather than risk defeat, Arlen cast them both from a precipice, leaving the world without a savior, and opening a struggle for succession that threatens to tear the Free Cities of Thesa apart.</p> <p>In the south, Inevera, Jardirâ€™s first wife, must find a way to keep their sons from killing one another and plunging their people into civil war as they strive for glory enough to make a claim on the throne.</p> <p>In the north, Leesha Paper and Rojer Inn struggle to forge an alliance between the duchies of Angiers and Miln against the Krasians before it is too late.</p> <p>Caught in the crossfire is the duchy of Lakton - rich and unprotected, ripe for conquest.</p> <p>All the while, the corelings have been growing stronger, and without Arlen and Jardir there may be none strong enough to stop them. Only Renna Bales may know more about the fate of the missing men, but she, too, has disappeared.</p> <p>Performed by Dylan Lynch, Eva Wilhelm, Kimberly Gilbert, Joe Brack, Christopher Scheeren, Alyssa Wilmoth, Bradley Smith, Drew Kopas, Lily Beacon, Ken Jackson, Katy Carkuff, Michael John Casey, Michael Glenn, Colleen Delany, Nanette Savard, Casie Platt, Andy Brownstein, Nick DePinto, Christopher Graybill, Mort Shelby, Rose Elizabeth Supan, Eric Messner, Scott McCormick, David Coyne, Julie-Ann Elliott, James Lewis, Richard Rohan, Yasmin Tuazon, Gabriela Fernandez-Coffey, Johann Dettweiler, Danny Gavigan, Thomas Penny, Laura C Harris, Evan Casey, Terence Aselford, Tim Getman, Nora Achrati, Ren Kasey, Deidre Starnes, Lara Supan.</p>";
