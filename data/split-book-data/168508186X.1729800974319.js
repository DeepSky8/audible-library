Stirling presents his first novel of the Change, the start of the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling post-apocalyptic saga set in a world where all technology has been rendered useless. </p> <p>The Change occurred when an electrical storm centered over the island of Nantucket produced a blinding white flash that rendered all electronic devices and fuels inoperable - and plunged the world into a dark age humanity was unprepared to face.... </p> <p>Michael Havel was flying over Idaho en route to the holiday home of his passengers when the plane’s engines inexplicably died, forcing a less than perfect landing in the wilderness. And as Michael leads his charges to safety, he begins to realize that the engine failure was not an isolated incident. </p> <p>Juniper Mackenzie was singing and playing guitar in a pub when her small Oregon town was thrust into darkness. Now, taking refuge in her family’s cabin with her daughter and a growing circle of friends, Juniper is determined to create a farming community to benefit the survivors of this crisis. </p> <p>But even as people band together to help one another, others are building armies for conquest....</p>";
