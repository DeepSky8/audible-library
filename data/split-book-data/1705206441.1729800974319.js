window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>They call her the Sleeping Princess, but Celeste is far from asleep...</b></p> <p>Celeste has been cursed since her 16th birthday - just not in the way the rest of the kingdom thinks. All they see is her breath-taking beauty, marred by her foolishness. Only she knows that she retains her brilliant mind. And it's a secret she must keep at all costs.</p> <p>Over the years she's grown accustomed to the necessary deception. After all, her life depends on it. And she's even found a way to protect her kingdom, working from the shadows. But now a dangerous new threat has emerged, one that Celeste can't defeat alone. She needs the help of a newly-arrived prince. One who's altogether too handsome and too charming. Somehow she needs to keep her secret, save her kingdom, and find a way to free herself from the curse. The last thing she has time to do is sleep.</p> <p>In this reimagining of the classic fairy tale,<i> Sleeping Beauty</i>, it's only the princess' mind that is asleep. And sometimes appearances can be deceiving.</p>";
