Fans cannot get enough of the feasting, fighting, and fantastic adventures that fill every book. <p> A horrifying creature has landed on the shores of Mossflower country: Gulo the Savage, a wolverine who is known to devour his enemies' flesh. Gulo intends to kill his brother and seize a mighty relic known as the Walking Stone. But standing in Gulo's way is Redwall Abbey and a mercenary squirrel named Rakkety Tam MacBurl. Soon, the Mossflower woods are ringing with the glorious sound of battlecries, as an epic battle that tests the bonds of comradeship begins.</p> <p> Thanks to the extraordinary vocal talents of a full cast of accomplished performers, joined by the author himself, each wondrous character is fully brought to life, and <i>Rakkety Tam</i> becomes a riveting listening experience that is not easily forgotten.</p>";
