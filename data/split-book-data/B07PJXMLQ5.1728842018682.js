window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This Audible Exclusive production revisits one of Dickens' most popular novels: <i>Oliver Twist</i>, narrated by internationally acclaimed, award-winning actor Jonathan Pryce. </p> <p>Part of the Dickens Collection, an exclusive series of unmissable performances, <i>Oliver Twist</i> is a gleaming example of the genius and foresight of Charles Dickens. </p> <p>When young orphan, Oliver Twist, is sold into an apprenticeship with an undertaker, he leaves behind years of miserable servitude and mistreatment at an English workhouse. Hoping to move on to better things, he decides to escape his new, equally dreary surroundings and head to London. </p> <p>It is there that the novel unravels as Oliver meets a host of larger-than-life characters, including The Artful Dodger, a high-ranking member of a juvenile pickpocketing gang, and their elderly leader, Fagin. </p> <p>Desperate for affection and the sense of belonging that he has never known, Oliver unwittingly throws himself into a life of petty theft, which soon takes a violent turn with the introduction of one of Dickens' most terrifying characters, Bill Sikes. </p> <p>Exposing the cruel and inhumane treatment of orphans in 19th-century England, Dickens created one of the most significant social novels of all time. With it, he condemned the establishment for neglecting homeless children and leaving them vulnerable to recruiters who would exploit and abuse them. <i>Oliver Twist</i> cemented Dickens’ reputation as one of the most talented, influential and revolutionary of English authors. </p> <p>Following his father’s incarceration, Charles Dickens had to abandon his studies at a young age and set to work in a factory so as to support himself. Despite his short-lived education, Dickens went on to write 15 novels, various articles, novellas and short stories. He lectured and led campaigns for children's rights and education and arguably became the ultimate self-made man.</p> <p>Jonathan Pryce is an award-winning actor of the stage and screen. He is best known for <i>Brazil</i>, <i>Glengarry Glen Ross</i>, <i>Evita</i>, <i>Tomorrow Never Dies</i>, and the Pirates of the Caribbean series as well as his widely recognised performances as High Sparrow in HBO’s <i>Game of Thrones</i> and Cardinal Wolsey in BBC’s <i>Wolf Hall</i>. </p> <p>Jonathan most recently starred opposite Glenn Close in the critically acclaimed film <i>The Wife</i>, directed by Björn Runge. He can soon be seen as Don Quixote in Terry Gilliam’s <i>The Man Who Killed Don Quixote</i> and in the upcoming Netflix feature film <i>The Pope</i>, directed by Fernando Meirelles, in which he stars as Pope Francis opposite Anthony Hopkins.</p>";
