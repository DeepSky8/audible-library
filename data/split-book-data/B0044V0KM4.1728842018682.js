window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Quixotic is a word that the dictionary defines as \"extravagantly chivalrous or romantic; visionary....\" and that is a fitting definition, indeed, for this charming retelling of <i>Don Quixote</i>, the 17th-century Spanish classic by Miguel de Cervantes, now updated for the modern listener. The gallant and fragile Quixote will touch listeners, as will his faithful squire Sancho Panza and the tragically beautiful heroine of the gentle Don’s chivalries, the fair Dulcinea. </p> <p><i>Don Quixote</i> is rightfully noted to \"....move to pity rather than ridicule, and to tears as well as laughter. And herein lies its chief claim to greatness - that it seems to have been written not for one country nor for one age alone, but to give delight to all humankind.\"</p>";
