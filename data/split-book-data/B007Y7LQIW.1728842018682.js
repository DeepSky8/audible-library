window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Greg Wise reads Pierre Boulle's chilling, iconic novel about a nightmare world where apes rule over men. In a spaceship that can travel at the speed of light, Ulysse, a journalist, sets off from Earth for the nearest solar system. He finds there a planet which resembles his own, except that on Soror humans behave like animals and are hunted by a civilised race of primates. Captured and sent to a research facility, Ulysse must convince the apes of their mutual origins. But such revelations have always been greeted by prejudice and fear...</p> <p>The inspiration for several acclaimed cult films, <i>Planet of the Apes</i> is both a gripping, disturbing fable and a classic of science fiction.</p>";
