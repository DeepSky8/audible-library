window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Little Women</i> is the story of a wife and her four daughters living in genteel poverty in the environs of Boston while the father is away as a chaplain in the Union Army during the Civil War.</p> <p>So natural are the actions and dialogue of the charming Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, that even today <i>Little Women</i> is enjoyable without a sense of Victorian stiffness.</p> <p>This heartwarming story is Louisa May Alcott's masterpiece. She was born in German town Pennsylvania in 1832. Before becoming an author, she was a nurse at the Union hospital in Georgetown during the Civil War. She died in 1888.</p> <p>Lots Duncan says of <i>Little Women</i>: \"It speaks directly to the hearts of people of any generation who know what it's like to be part of a caring family.\"</p>";
