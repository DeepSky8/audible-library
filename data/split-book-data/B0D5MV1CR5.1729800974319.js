window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A gripping, full-cast science-fiction drama for fans of time travel, conspiracy theories, and unexplained phenomena.</b></p> <p>In the not-too-distant future, a 21-member crew launches from Earth. Their mission: to establish a temporary colony on Mars. Little do they know that colony will become permanent–and the last stand of the human race. Because, without warning, every single person left on Earth simply...vanishes.</p> <p>Now, a thousand years later, the resources needed to sustain life are running out, and the very existence of the Mars colony is threatened. Humankind has only one option–to return to its home planet.</p> <p>But is Earth safe? Could the Vanishing happen again?</p> <p>To get answers, two teams are launched back in time–one to New York City before the Vanishing; another to follow a bizarre trail of clues through history, from Area 51 to the lost Roanoke colony, and beyond.</p> <p>There are forces, though, that don’t want the Temporal mission to succeed. And a mysterious being whose own agenda might destroy them all.</p>";
