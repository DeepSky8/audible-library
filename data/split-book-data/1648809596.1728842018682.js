He’s also an immortal, peerless in the arts of war. Over the centuries, he’s worn many faces to hide his gift, but he is a man ill-fit for obscurity and all too often he’s become a hero, his very names passing into legend: Acaelus Thorne, Yric the Black, Hrothan Steelbender, Tal Drakkan, Rebus Nimble.</p> <p>But when Gaelan must take a job hunting down the world’s finest assassins for the beautiful courtesan-and-crimelord Gwinvere Kirena, what he finds may destroy everything he’s ever believed in.</p> <p>Performed by Dylan Lynch, David Coyne, Johann Dettweiler, Tim Getman, Karen Carbone, Michael Glenn, James Lewis, Joe Brack, Scott McCormick, Nanette Savard, Kimberly Gilbert, Mort Shelby, Richard Rohan, Ken Jackson, Terence Aselford.</p>";
