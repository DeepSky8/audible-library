window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One of the most widely read novels of the 20th century, W. Somerset Maugham's masterpiece, <i>Of Human Bondage</i>, gives a harrowing depiction of unrequited love. Philip Carey, a sensitive orphan born with a clubfoot, finds himself in desperate need of passion and inspiration. He abandons his studies to travel, first to Heidelberg and then to Paris, where he nurses ambitions of becoming a great artist. </p> <p>Philip's youthful idealism erodes, however, as he comes face-to-face with his own mediocrity and lack of impact on the world. After returning to London to study medicine, he becomes wildly infatuated with Mildred, a vulgar, tawdry waitress, and begins a doomed love affair that will change the course of his life. </p> <p>First published in 1915, the semi-autobiographical <i>Of Human Bondage</i> combines the values left over from the Victorian era with the prevailing irony and despair of the early 20th century. Unsentimental yet bursting with deep feeling, <i>Of Human Bondage</i> remains Maugham's most complete statement of the importance of physical and spiritual liberty, a theme that resounds more loudly than ever today.</p>";
