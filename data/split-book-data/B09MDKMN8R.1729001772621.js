window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Brought to you by Penguin.</b></p> <p>The audiobook of <i>Men At Arms</i> is narrated by impressionist and actor Jon Culshaw, best known for BBC Radio 4â€™s <i>Dead Ringers</i>, and for the Doctor Who audiobooks and dramas. BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>; <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>; <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (<i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i>; <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.</p> <p><b>'PEOPLE OUGHT TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES... THE PROBLEM IS, PEOPLE ONLY THINK FOR THEMSELVES IF YOU TELL THEM TO.'</b><br> <br> Times are a-changing in Ankh-Morpork's Night Watch.<br> <br> New recruits have been hired to reflect the city's diversity, including Corporal Carrot (technically a dwarf), Lance-constable Cuddy (really a dwarf), Lance-constable Detritus (a troll), and Lance-constable Angua (a woman... full moons aside).<br> <br> What's more, Captain Sam Vimes is getting married and retiring from the Watch. For good. Which is a shame, because no one knows the streets of Ankh-Morpork or its criminal underworld better than him.<br> <br> And someone armed and dangerous has been getting ideas about power and destiny and lost kings, committing a string of seemingly random murders across the city.<br> <br> The new recruits will need to learn <i>fast...</i></p> <p><i>Men At Arms</i><b> </b>is the second book in the City Watch series, but you can listen to the Discworld novels in any order.</p> <p>The first book in the Discworld series - <i>The Colour of Magic</i> - was published in 1983. Some elements of the Discworld universe may reflect this.</p>";
