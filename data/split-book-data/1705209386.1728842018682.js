The quantum world doesn't play by those rules. </b></p> <p>Daniel Rice is a government science investigator whose specialty is solving seemingly intractable problems through scientific inquiry. </p> <p>But Daniel's intellectual strength is sorely tested by the bizarre realities he finds in the quantum world. Extra dimensions of space trap the unwary, probability replaces cause and effect, and time isn't what anyone imagined. The other side of the mirror is a place full of dangers, but it's also somewhere a dedicated scientist can uncover secrets that connect humans with something greater.</p>";
