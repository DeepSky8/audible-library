window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What does it feel like to have the whole world know they owe you their salvation? Is it pride? Basking in self-admiration? A realization of your own greatness against the backdrop of anonymity shared by everyone else? There are lots of possibilities, only none of them describe what actually happened.</p> <p>Instead of becoming the savior, Leg Ondo was made a mockery. The being governing the planet forbade his totems and chosen people to disclose information about the battle between the demons and dragons. And that left the world confused. What did the Brown Bear Clan do to deserve the avalanche of goodies that came pouring down on it? Should they be knocked off the pedestal they so recently climbed atop?</p> <p>But even that would be manageable if it weren't for one thing: the multilevel competition designed to bring the three empires closer together. How did Leg Ondo possibly get himself involved this time?</p>";
