window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Most people are unaware that Mark Twain spent over a decade researching Saint Joan of Arc and wrote what he considered to be his greatest work - <i>Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc </i>- originally published in <i>Harper's Magazine</i> in 1895 as chapters attributed to the fictitious author Sieur Louis de Conte. </p> <p>When the public found out that Twain was actually the author, many were suspicious, thinking Twain was perpetrating some kind of a joke. Twain's biographer Albert Paine defends Twain saying it is actually his greatest writing: \"Considered from every point of view, <i>Joan of Arc </i>is Mark Twain's supreme literary expression, the loftiest, the most delicate, the most luminous example of his work.\"</p>";
