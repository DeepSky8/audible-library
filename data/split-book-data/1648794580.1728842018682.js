window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When does an empire fall?</b></p> <p>The Seven Satrapies have collapsed into four - and those are falling before the White King's armies.</p> <p>Gavin Guile, ex-emperor, ex-Prism, ex-galley slave, formerly the one man who might have averted war, is now lost, broken, and trapped in a prison crafted by his own hands to hold a great magical genius. But Gavin has no magic at all. Worse, in this prison Gavin may not be alone.</p> <p>Kip Guile will make a last desperate attempt to stop the White King's growing horde. Karris White attempts to knit together an empire falling apart, helped only by her murderous and possibly treasonous father-in-law, Andross Guile.</p> <p>Meanwhile Teia's new talents will find a darker use - and the cost might be too much to bear. Together they will fight to prevent a tainted empire from becoming something even worse.</p> <p>Performed by Richard Rohan, Joe Brack, Yasmin Tuazon, Christopher Scheeren, Ren Casey, Alyssa Wilmoth, Elliot Dash, Johann Dettweiler, David Coyne, Scott McCormick, Michael Glenn, Thomas Keegan, Michael John Casey, Kimberly Gilbert, Nick DePinto, Nanette Savard, Andy Clemence, Bradley Smith, Chris Genebach, Lily Beacon, Chris Davenport, Audrey Bertaux, Colleen Delany, Mort Shelby, Rose Elizabeth Supan, Dawn Ursula, Ken Jackson, Robbie Gay, Terence Aselford, Thomas Penny, Bruce Alan Rauscher, Dylan Lynch, Delores King Williams, Elizabeth Jernigan.</p>";
