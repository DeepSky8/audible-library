window.bookSummaryJSON = "The free-spirited Anne Shirley has a beautiful way of looking at the world and touching our hearts. In this, the third volume of the <i>Anne of Green Gables</i> series, the irrepressible Anne dreams of the woman she hopes to be when she decides to leave Green Gables and her beloved Prince Edward Island for college. She is eager for new adventure. But now she faces difficult choices involving her secret aspirations to be a writer and her hopes of finding the right person to marry. Homesickness and a grumpy old math professor cause Anne to doubt she should be a Redmond College coed, even though her old friends Gilbert Blythe and Priscilla Grant are there to share the challenges and surprises. And when Anne is the recipient of unexpected marriage proposals from the most unlikely men, she may shock friends and Islanders alike with her decision.";
