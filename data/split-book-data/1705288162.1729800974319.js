But the men and women of their expeditionary forces are trapped behind enemy lines on a besieged planet. Losing those troops will lose the war. Their only hope? A last ditch rescue mission led by Captain Hal Cutter and his battleship, <i>Achilles</i>.</p> <p><i>Titan's Vengeance</i>: The Reach. A vast barren tract of space lying between the besieged stars of the Kingdom of New Avalon and their distant allies.

A master tactician commanding the most powerful vessel in space, the battleship Behemoth. He is dispatched into the Reach with a single goal: to sever the long, tenuous supply lines linking the Kingdom to the Liberty Federation. </p> <p><i>A Relentless Fury</i>: One after another, the Kingdom's star bases have fallen before the New Hegemony and their coalition. Only one remains in the strategically vital Talos Rift: Valestra.</p>";
