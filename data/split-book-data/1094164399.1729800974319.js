That made her just the right age: old enough to be used, young enough to be broken. Or so the slavers thought. But Sassy turned out to be a little different from your typical slave girl. Maybe it was her unusual physical strength. </p> <p>Maybe it was her friendship with the captured Fleet crewman. Maybe it was her spirit. Whatever it was, it wouldn’t let her resign herself to the life of a slave. She bided her time, watched for her moment. Finally it came, and she escaped.</p> <p>But that was only the beginning for Sassinak. Now she’s a Fleet Captain with a pirate-chasing ship of her own, and only one regret in her life: not enough pirates.</p>";
