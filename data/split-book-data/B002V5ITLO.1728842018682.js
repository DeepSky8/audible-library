window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This compelling spiritual quest by Hermann Hesse, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1946, is considered one of the most important works of 20th century fiction. Siddhartha's search for enlightenment leads him to the river of life itself. On his journey he learns from many teachers: the ascetic Samanas, the all-knowing Gotama the Buddha, Kamala the lovely courtesan, and Vasudeva the simple ferryman. Unwilling to accept the wisdom of others, Siddhartha comes to an understanding of himself and his place in the universe, finally achieving the enlightened state of mind in which he can say to his lifelong friend: \"The world, Govinda, is perfect at every moment.\"</p>";
