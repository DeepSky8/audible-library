window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Hugo Award-winning author Charles Stross delivers “credible and bold SF” (<i>Science Fiction Weekly</i>) that continually pushes the boundaries of the genre. With <i>Glasshouse</i>, Stross pens a Kafkaesque tale set in a 27th-century of teleport gates and mind-attacking network worms. </p> <p>After Robin awakes in a clinic, he struggles to summon details of his life, but too many of his memories have been wiped clean. More troubling is the stark awareness of immediate danger: someone is trying to kill him. On the run, Robin makes a desperate gamble and volunteers for what he hopes is the sanctuary of an unusual study at the Glasshouse. Once there, however, he realizes the true terror has only begun. </p> <p>Stross pulls out all the stops in a searing adventure that will keep listeners’ hearts racing. Propelled by Kevin R. Free’s riveting narration, <i>Glasshouse</i> is a novel SF fans will not soon forget.</p>";
