window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Orphaned at an early age, the young girl Heidi finds a home high in the Swiss Alps with her reclusive grandfather. There, each glorious day is filled with discovery, adventure and the friendship of a gentle goat boy, Peter. But when Heidi is sent away from her mountain paradise to a large, cold city, she is determined to find a way to return to the place she loves. </p> <p>For generations, children around the world have fallen under the spell of this small alpine girl. <i>Heidi</i> is the heartwarming story of an exuberant child’s goodness, courage, and love. Filled with unforgettable characters and majestic scenery, it is an enduring classic of children’s literature. </p> <p>Author Johanna Spyri lived her entire life in a small Swiss town near Zurich. <i>Heidi,</i> first published in 1881, is a largely autobiographical work that echoes Ms. Spyri’s affection for the countryside, flowers and animals that surrounded her. John McDonough brings <i>Heidi</i> vibrantly to life, enriching this beloved tale with the warmth and drama of his narration.</p>";
