window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Confessions of St. Augustine</i> is one of the most moving diaries ever recorded of a man's journey to the fountain of God's grace. Writing as a sinner, not a saint, Augustine shares his innermost thoughts and conversion experiences, and wrestles with the spiritual questions that have stirred the hearts of the thoughtful since time began.</p> <p>Starting with his childhood in Numidia and continuing through his youth and early adulthood in Carthage, Rome, and Milan, this book shows Augustine as a human being, a fellow traveler on the road to salvation. If you are fighting changes in your life, struggling to know God more, or staggering around roadblocks in your faith, Augustine's confessions will stretch your mind and enrich your soul.</p>";
