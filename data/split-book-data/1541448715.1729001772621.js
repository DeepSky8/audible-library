window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Virtual worlds are places of boundless freedom. Anyone can become an elven mage or an invisible rogue, join a clan, and go on raids, fight, develop their characters, and most importantly, escape from the daily grind. </p> <p>However, a game is only a game if you can quit. This is something I learned the hard way. I just wanted to let off some steam in virtual reality and ended up getting murdered and imprisoned in the body of one of the undead - slow, clumsy, and cursed to die at the hand of other players over and over again. </p> <p>The only way out of this awful predicament was to find the legendary Scroll of Rebirth, but the helpless plague-ridden corpse would need to be turned into a real killing machine. If only people knew what it was like to level up a dead rogue....</p>";
