Here we meet Natty Bumppo as a young man living in upstate New York in the early 1740s. The action begins as Bumppo, called \"Deerslayer\", and his friend Hurry Harry approach Lake Glimmerglass, or Oswego, where the trapper Thomas Hutter lives with his daughters, the beautiful Judith and the feeble-minded Hetty. Hutter's floating log fort is attacked by Iroquois Indians, and the two frontiersmen join in the fight.";
