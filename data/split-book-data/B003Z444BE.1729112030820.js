window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In Volume One of the <i>Crimson Shadow</i> series, young Luthien Bedwyr rebelled against the vicious rule of Wizard-King Greensparrow and his cruel wizard-lords. In Volume Two, he made use of a magical cape that renders its wearer invisible---except for a lingering crimson silhouette.</p> <p>Now, the evil Greensparrow is back - and with a vengeance. Using dark, hideous magic, Greensparrow has taken the form of a massive dragon - a virtually unstoppable force that only Luthien can defeat.</p>";
