window.bookSummaryJSON = "Widely regarded as the first English novel, Daniel Defoe's <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> is one of the most popular and influential adventure stories of all time. <p>This classic tale of shipwreck and survival on an uninhabited island was an instant success when first published in 1719, and it has inspired countless imitations.</p> <p>In his own words, Robinson Crusoe tells of the terrible storm that drowned all his shipmates and left him marooned on a deserted island. Forced to overcome despair, doubt, and self-pity, he struggles to create a life for himself in the wilderness. From practically nothing, Crusoe painstakingly learns how to make pottery, grow crops, domesticate livestock, and build a house. His many adventures are recounted in vivid detail, including a fierce battle with cannibals and his rescue of Friday, the man who becomes his trusted companion.</p> <p>Full of enchanting detail and daring heroics, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> is a celebration of courage, patience, ingenuity, and hard work.</p>";
