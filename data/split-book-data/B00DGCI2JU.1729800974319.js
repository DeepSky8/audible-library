window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"It is the heart of this place, and it is dying,\" says the Beast. And it is true; the center of the Beast's palace, the glittering glasshouse that brings Beauty both comfort and delight in her strange new environment, is filled with leafless brown rosebushes. But deep within this enchanted world, new life, at once subtle and strong, is about to awaken. Twenty years ago Robin McKinley enthralled listeners with the power of <i>Beauty.</i> Now this extraordinarily gifted novelist retells the story of Beauty and the Beast again - but in a totally new way, with fresh perspective, ingenuity, and mature insight. In <i>Rose Daughter</i> she has written her finest and most deeply felt work, a compelling, richly imagined, and haunting exploration of the transformative power of love.</p>";
