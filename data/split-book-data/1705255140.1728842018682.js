window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Is there anything better than a quiet life? Well, there's a quiet life surrounded by people you care about, people who love you in return, of course. But Tailyn Vlashich knew nothing of the kind. His parents had died years before, the townspeople stayed well away from the god's favorite, and his guardian just wanted to be rid of him. </p> <p>That was the setting when Tailyn was again placed on the road to uncertainty, beset by terrifying lixes, and hounded by a harsh trainer it was impossible to please. All he can do is bear up and keep pushing forward in the hopes that his wishes will be granted. </p> <p>As legend has it, somewhere ahead lies the Forest of Desire, a place capable of bringing to life one's every wish. For example, returning Valia Levor, Tailyn's betrothed, who was kidnapped. Oh, and does anyone know why Forian Tarn still isn't back from his trip?</p>";
