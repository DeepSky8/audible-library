window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Flying Flamingo Sisters—Flo, Faye, and Franny—are back for another hilarious, heartfelt, and soaring adventure in their barnstorming biplane! This highly anticipated sequel from best-selling author Carrie Seim will delight fans of Indiana Jones, <i>Encanto</i>, and Lemony Snicket. Performed as a 1930s radio drama, it’s bursting with humor for all ages, orchestral scoring, and famous voices from stage and screen.</p> <p>Convinced that their dastardly uncle Freidrich has escaped with their family fortune, the Flamingo Sisters return home to the Upper Lower Valley Mountain Rural Region in despair. But when their beloved mentor Elsie de la Rue goes missing—and they discover a new clue that may lead them to their lost Golden Flamingo—the three sisters take off on another thrilling chase in the skies! They join the death-defying pilots of the Women’s Air Derby, then hopscotch from New York to France to Egypt, determined to stop their uncle (who believes girls should never fly aeroplanes) from spreading evil across the globe.</p> <p>The Flamingo Sisters must use wits, courage, and derring-do to solve secret codes (and sibling spats), trek through terrifying temples, rescue their ace pilot parents, and save Elsie de la Rue. Not to mention themselves!</p> <p>Now available in Dolby Atmos on Audible.</p>";
