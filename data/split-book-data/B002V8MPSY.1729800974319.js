window.bookSummaryJSON = "Hailed as one of the world's supreme masterpieces on the subject of death and dying, Leo Tolstoy's \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\" is the story of a worldly careerist, a high court judge who has never given the inevitability of his death so much as a passing thought. But one day, death announces itself to him, and to his shocked surprise he is brought face to face with his own mortality. <p>How, Tolstoy asks, does an unreflective man confront his one and only moment of truth? This novella was the artistic culmination of a profound spiritual crisis in Tolstoy's life, a nine-year period following the publication of <i>Anna Karenina</i> during which he wrote not a word of fiction. A thoroughly absorbing and, at times, terrifying glimpse into the abyss of death, it is also a strong testament to the possibility of finding spiritual salvation. </p> <p>Also included in this volume are \"The Forged Coupon,\" \"After the Dance,\" \"My Dream,\" \"There Are No Guilty People,\" and \"The Young Tsar.\"</p>";
