window.bookSummaryJSON = "This endearing, heartwarming book has charmed generations of children and parents since it was first published in 1908. A true literary classic, <i>Anne of Green Gables</i> has given the world the spunky, irrepressible little girl who Mark Twain hailed as \"the most moving and delightful child of fiction since the immortal Alice.\" To date, more than 50 million copies of the books in the series have been sold. <p>On Prince Edward Island, aging siblings Mathew and Marilla Cuthbert decide to adopt a boy to help with chores around the farm. But when Mathew arrives at the train platform, the only living creature in sight, legs dangling from the piles of shingles where she sits, is a freckled, green-eyed, redheaded little girl. Mathew senses immediately that life at Green Gables is going to be very different. And how right he is. The independent and fiery girl, Anne, changes the Cuthberts' lives immeasurably, and for the better.</p>";
