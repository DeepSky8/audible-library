I put that to the test when I run headfirst into a fight that brings all my secrets, and reality as I know it, crashing down around me. Now, I'm looking for answers and trying to piece together what the hell is going on. Paranormal is my new way of life. It's not going to be easy, and I'm not exactly welcome. </p> <p>That is, until I meet the boys, and trust me, they are anything but boyish. </p> <p>I'm up against elders who think I'm too powerful, a family who views me as a threat, and something lurking in the shadows that's been coming for me my whole life. </p> <p>There's not a chance in hell I'm going down without a fight. I'm not lost anymore, and I'm about to show this world exactly what I can do. </p> <p><b><i>Contains mature themes.</i></b></p>";
