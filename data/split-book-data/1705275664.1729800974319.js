It's soon clear to amateur sleuth Lucy that murder's in the air and that the culprit is one of the knitters.</p> <p>This is a fun take on a classic closed-room mystery. Of course, no room is every closed when vampires live downstairs. But are the undead knitters to blame? Or is there more to this Oxford knitting circle than lumpy Santas and light-up reindeer?</p>";
