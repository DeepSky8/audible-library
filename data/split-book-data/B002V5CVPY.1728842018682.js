window.bookSummaryJSON = "<b>Translated and read by Seamus Heaney.</b> <p><i>New York Times</i> best seller and Whitebread Book of the Year, Nobel Laureate Seamus Heaney's new translation of <i>Beowulf</i> comes to life in this gripping audio. Heaney's performance reminds us that <i>Beowulf</i>, written near the turn of another millennium, was intended to be heard not read.</p> <p>Composed toward the end of the first millennium of our era, <i>Beowulf</i> is the elegiac narrative of the adventures of Beowulf, a Scandinavian hero who saves the Danes from the seemingly invincible monster Grendel and, later, from Grendel's mother. He then returns to his own country and lives to old age before dying in a vivid fight against a dragon.</p> <p>The poem is about encountering the monstrous, defeating it, and then having to live on in the exhausted aftermath. In the contours of this story, at once remote and uncannily familiar at the end of the twentieth century, Seamus Heaney finds a resonance that summons power to the poetry from deep beneath its surface.</p>";
