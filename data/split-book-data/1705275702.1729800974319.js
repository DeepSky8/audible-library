window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A secret society leads to murder</b></p> <p>The Gargoyle Club is a secret society in Oxford's Cardinal College, where privileged young men from important families get drunk and rowdy and cause trouble. Rafe, as a member of the club, is not impressed with these newest Gargoyles.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a social-climbing high school friend of Lucy's is in town. Is she really after an art history degree, or is her purpose more devious?</p> <p>When someone dies during a club dinner, it looks like more than boys behaving badly. It's up to Lucy and her undead knitters to solve the crime.</p> <p>From a <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author. This is part of the Vampire Knitting Club series, but each book can be listened to as a stand-alone. These books are free of swearing and gore and packed full of quirky characters, magic, a touch of romance, and a lot of fun. Join the club today. Being undead not a requirement.</p>";
