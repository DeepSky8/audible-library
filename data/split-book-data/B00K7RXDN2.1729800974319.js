window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Prolific novelist Stross pauses to collect short stories that have not (yet) been stitched up into his longer work. Stories that move the US - USSR conflict onto a massive disk in another galaxy (Locus Award-winner \"Missile Gap\"), offer a spam-filter solution to the Fermi paradox (\"MAXOS\"), and suggest clever bargains with the devil in a newly frozen Scotland (\"Snowball's Chance\") demonstrate Stross's ability to crisscross genres, blending SF, fantasy, horror, and espionage.</p>";
