window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Headphones recommended. </p> <p>In this non-binary and body positive piece, a meticulous tailor measures you for a bespoke suit and converses with you while he works. The tactile sounds of fabrics, buttons, a suit brush, hangers, and more create an immersive sound experience. </p> <p>Whisperlodge is a pioneering New York-based company that performs live ASMR events around the country. Their collaboration with us is the first time they've allowed their work to be recorded, and you can now experience the talent of their renowned ASMRtists at home. Due to its ability to deeply relax the mind and body, ASMR has become a source of calm and pleasure for millions.
