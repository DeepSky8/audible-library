window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When does an empire fall?</b></p> <p>The Seven Satrapies have collapsed into four - and those are falling before the White King's armies.</p> <p>Gavin Guile, ex-emperor, ex-Prism, ex-galley slave, formerly the one man who might have averted war, is now lost, broken, and trapped in a prison crafted by his own hands to hold a great magical genius. But Gavin has no magic at all. Worse, in this prison Gavin may not be alone.</p> <p>Kip Guile will make a last desperate attempt to stop the White King's growing horde. Karris White attempts to knit together an empire falling apart, helped only by her murderous and possibly treasonous father-in-law, Andross Guile.</p> <p>Meanwhile Teia's new talents will find a darker use - and the cost might be too much to bear. Together they will fight to prevent a tainted empire from becoming something even worse.</p> <p>Performed by Richard Rohan, Joe Brack, Christopher Scheeren, Yasmin Tuazon, Alyssa Wilmoth, Ren Casey, Michael Glenn, Elliot Dash, Colleen Delany, Thomas Keegan, Barbara Pinolini, Bradley Smith, Johann Dettweiler, Audrey Bertaux, Nora Achrati, Michael John Casey, Nick DePinto, Thomas Penny, Dylan Lynch, Steven Carpenter, David Coyne, Mort Shelby, Rose Elizabeth Supan, Ken Jackson, Andy Clemence, Kimberly Gilbert, Jeff Allin, Terence Aselford, Robbie Gay, Scott McCormick, Chris Davenport, Lawrence Redmond, James Lewis, Jonathan Lee Taylor, Delores King Williams, Dani Stoller, Danny Gavigan.</p>";
