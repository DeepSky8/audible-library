window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Imagine that you are a little boy. Your handsome father is dead, and each day your beautiful mother grows weaker from grief. The two of you have little money, and even less hope for the future. Would you want to give up, or can you be brave? Now a surprising message comes from England. You are heir to a title, a lordship. Soon, you will be on your way to live with a wealthy but grumpy old uncle, whom you have never met. But you are going to live with him in a castle! This is the story of Little Lord Fauntleroy. Listen to his journey from rags to riches; it is a story full of surprises. Often, the caricature festooned with golden curls and velvet suits has kept listeners from discovering <i>Little Lord Fauntleroy</i> for themselves. No matter what age you are, take this opportunity to listen to a classic that will captivate you with its delightful charm, humor, and insight. Narrator Virginia Leishman’s delicate phrasing is the perfect complement to Frances Hodgson Burnett’s timeless novel.</p>";
