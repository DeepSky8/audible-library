window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Brought to you by Penguin.</b></p> <p>The audiobook of <i>Guards! Guards!</i> is narrated by impressionist and actor Jon Culshaw, best known for BBC Radio 4â€™s <i>Dead Ringers</i>, and for the Doctor Who audiobooks and dramas. BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>; <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>; <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (<i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i>; <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.</p> <p><b>'NOBLE DRAGONS DON'T HAVE FRIENDS. THE NEAREST THEY CAN GET TO THE IDEA IS AN ENEMY WHO IS STILL ALIVE.'</b></p> <p>The city of Ankh-Morpork is in turmoil, its citizens revolting. Again.<br> <br> A shadowy secret brotherhood has summoned a dragon to spread terror throughout the city, intent on overthrowing the Patrician and ruling in his place. Too bad the dragon has ideas of its own...<br> <br> It's up to Captain Sam Vimes and the ramshackle Night Watch to stop it. Only problem is, the Watch are more used to dealing with mobs than dragons.<br> <br> And if they can't bring down this fire-breathing tyrant and reinstate their own, slightly less dangerous one, Ankh-Morpork might be lost. For ever...</p> <p><b>With an afterword by Ben Aaronovitch.</b></p> <p><i>Guards! Guards!</i> is the first book in the City Watch series, but you can listen to the Discworld novels in any order.</p> <p>The first book in the Discworld series - <i>The Colour of Magic</i> - was published in 1983. Some elements of the Discworld universe may reflect this.</p>";
