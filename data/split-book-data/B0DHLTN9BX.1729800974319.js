Salvatore.</b></p> <p>When Drizzt Do’Urden first entered Icewind Dale in 1347, he found a place quite unlike anywhere he had ever known, a land of freezing winds and ferocious monsters, of dramatic vistas and unrelenting challenges. Most of all, though, he found a land populated by folk who knew all too well the price of a misstep, whether walking into a yeti den or trusting a stranger.</p> <p>Making his way in those early days was no easy task, but Drizzt would find focus and joy in watching the antics of a girl and a bunch of dwarfs trying to keep her from getting herself killed. A girl who would become his friend, who would become a woman, who would become his wife.</p> <p>When Breezy Do’Urden, the daughter of that marriage, enters Icewind Dale more than 150 years later, she finds a land no more tamed. And while her father’s reputation has mostly smoothed the way for her among the ever-suspicious people, she carries her own concerns, confusion, and a trauma realized in the difficult journey through the Spine of the Word Mountain.</p> <p>She also carries the blood on her hands.</p>";
