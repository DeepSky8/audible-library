window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sara Crewe is the brightest, richest, and most generous girl in Miss Minchin’s school for girls, and her father gives her everything she might desire. But when her beloved father dies, Sara’s friends and prized possessions are suddenly taken away, and she is banished to the attic and forced to work as a common drudge. Fed only crumbs, she still saves enough to feed her pet rat, and she tells wonderful stories to comfort Becky, the kitchen maid. Using her special ability to play make-believe, she transforms her hardships into an unforgettable adventure. And soon, even her wildest wishes begin to come true, as her real identity is revealed once and for all. </p> <p>This touching classic has been a favorite with generations of children and adults who have delighted in Sara’s happiness, wept over her sorrows, and perhaps shared her need: to be recognized as someone unique and special. </p> <p>Frances Hodgson Burnett (1849 -1924) was an English-born author of romances and books for children.
