window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>More Barliona adventures from the best-selling author of the Way of the Shaman LitRPG series! </p> <p>Reality is cruel. The rising level of technological development has led to a rising level of unemployment. They're laying off everybody, from teachers to technical servicemen. What's the point of holding onto a person if they can be replaced by an advanced mechanism? </p> <p>But what are the people to do? How are they to live? Where are they to get money from? There is only one answer - Barliona. The official government project is gathering steam, luring more and more people into its net. Who knows how people will behave when they lose everything? </p> <p>Brody West is one such person. Unlike most, he doesn't lose heart. A professional project manager with 30 years in the business simply cannot do that. He has a goal, and a clear understanding of how to achieve it. Nobody can get in his way - not the new class, not the strange friend, and not the unexpected foes.</p>";
