window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Brought to you by Penguin.</b></p> <p>The audiobook of <i>The Fifth Elephant</i> is narrated by impressionist and actor Jon Culshaw, best known for BBC Radio 4’s <i>Dead Ringers</i>, and for the Doctor Who audiobooks and dramas. BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>; <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>; <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (<i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i>; <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.</p> <p><b>'WELL, HE THOUGHT, SO THIS IS DIPLOMACY. IT'S LYING, ONLY FOR A BETTER CLASS OF PEOPLE.'</b><br> <br> Commander Sam Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch is a long way from home.<br> <br> Sent as reluctant ambassador to Uberwald, a mysterious region inhabited by dwarfs, vampires and werewolves, Vimes must learn the art of diplomacy. Fast. But when he uncovers a mystery with ties back home, the policeman in him can't help but investigate. What could possibly go wrong?<br> <br> Well, quite a lot actually. Vimes finds himself on the run through the frozen forests of Uberwald, armed with only his wits and the trousers of Uncle Vanya (don't ask). And if he doesn't make it, there's going to be a terrible war.<br> <br> But there are monsters on his trail. They're smart. They're fast. They're werewolves.<br> <br> And they're catching up… </p> <p><i>The Fifth Elephant</i><b><i> </i></b>is the fifth book in the City Watch series, but you can listen to the Discworld novels in any order.</p> <p>The first book in the Discworld series - <i>The Colour of Magic</i> - was published in 1983. Some elements of the Discworld universe may reflect this.</p>";
