window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Get ready for this laugh-out-loud adventure and find out what's brewing next with the Davenport witches!</b></p> <p>I was hoping for a few days off from dealing with murder charges, bad guys, and the everyday paranormal bizarre. All I wanted was a nice break from all the crazy. And did I get it? No. Of course not.</p> <p>Instead, a new coven comes to town. A coven of witch females who call themselves The Sisters of the Circle, a small, elite group for the upper crust of witch societyâ€”according to Dolores.</p> <p>But there's something off about this coven, and I just can't put my finger on it. All the while, my aunts and other witches in town worship the ground they walk on like giddy fangirls.</p> <p>Forget my time off. What I got was a whole new set of problems as my life spirals down the crapper once again.</p> <p>If that isn't bad enough, a curse settles on Hollow Cove. Something dark, ominous, that threatens the lives of the townspeople. If I don't find the counter-curse in time, I could lose everything.</p> <p>And the clock is ticking . . .</p>";
