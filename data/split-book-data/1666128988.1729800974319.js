window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What the hex is going on?</p> <p>Life at Cardinal Woolsey's knitting and yarn shop is about as smooth as shop owner Lucy's knitting. In other words, lumpy, tangled, and prone to disaster. Much like her spell-casting. But things get worse when her cousin and shop assistant Violet shows alarming symptoms of a hex. Who would do such a thing? Was it the guy from Witch Date she blew off? Or is Lucy the real target?</p> <p>Meanwhile, Lucy's dating a much older man. Like five hundred years older. The gorgeous vampire Rafe wants to marry her, but there's more keeping them apart than an age gap. Can they make a May-medieval marriage work? Or will they say goodbye forever?</p> <p>When someone dies, either the hex is to blame or there's a murderer on the loose in Oxford.</p>";
