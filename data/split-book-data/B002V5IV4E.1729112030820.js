window.bookSummaryJSON = "For Edmond Dantes, life couldn't be better. At 19, he is soon to be captain of his own ship and about to be married to his true love, Mercedes. But his life is suddenly turned upside down when on his wedding day he is arrested. Without a fair trial, he is condemned to solitary confinement in the miserable Chateau d'If. Soon, it is clear that Edmond has been framed by a handful of powerful enemies, jealous of his success. <p>While locked away, Edmond learns from another prisoner, Abbe Faria, of a secret treasure hidden on the island of Monte Cristo. Faria teaches Edmond history, science, languages, and philosophy, turning him into a well-rounded individual. Edmond concocts a daring and audacious plan: escape and find the treasure. But years pass before Edmond can escape. Once he does, he transforms himself into the Count of Monte Cristo and launches his plan for revenge against those who imprisoned him. </p> <p>Alexandre Dumas was one of the most famous and prolific French writers of the 19th century, producing some 250 books. He is best known for his historical novels <i>The Three Musketeers</i> and <i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i>, and was among the first authors to fully exploit the possibilities of <i>roman feuilleton</i>, or \"serial novel\". Dumas is credited with revitalizing the historical novel in France. His works are riveting, fast-paced adventure tales that blend history and fiction. As a master of dialog and character development, Dumas composed some of the most emulated teaser scenes for his suspenseful chapter endings.</p>";
