What else is it going to take to become a true hero and save humanity? </p> <p>The only problem is that Mark Derwin has bigger problems, focused as he is on finding Squirrel, his sister. And he has to make sure she's still the same person she always was rather than a chunk of noa. He's prepared to do anything, go to any lengths to make that happen, including working with the game. But not with the game owner. Mark has quite the litany of questions for that character.</p>";
