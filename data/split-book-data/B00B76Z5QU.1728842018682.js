window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jo March, the irrepressible tomboy in <i>Little Women,</i> has grown up and married her professor to become Jo Bhaer. Together the Bhaers have established Plumfield - a warm-hearted, informal school where lessons are taught with a dose of laughter. When Nat, a young orphan joins the happy household at Plumfield, he can’t believe his good fortune. Each day is filled with studying and fun - the boys even enjoy Saturday-night pillow fights. But when Nat gets caught stretching the truth, he discovers there is more to learn in his new home than games and schoolwork. </p> <p>Filled with real-life characters and situations, Louisa M. Alcott’s spirited classic has touched the hearts and minds of young people from generation to generation. Barbara Caruso’s dramatic narration transports young adults to the late 1800s when life was simpler but was still packed with plenty of adventures.</p>";
