window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Winner of Audible UK’s 2017 Narrator of the Year Award</b> </p> <p>In an Audible Exclusive production, Golden Globe winner Joanne Froggatt gives a powerhouse performance of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, Emily Brontë's only published novel. This edition features an exclusive introduction written by Ann Dinsdale, Chief Curator of the Brontë Museum. </p> <p><b>About the book</b> </p> <p>The unapologetic intensity with which Emily Brontë wrote this story ensures that it will forever be considered one of the greatest works of English literature. A passionate tale of a chaotic and often violent love, <i>Wuthering Heights</i> transcends your average romance and, with its Gothic undertones, takes the listener on a journey through one man's lustful hunt for revenge. </p> <p>Believing he has been spurned by Cathy Earnshaw, the only woman he has ever loved, Heathcliff abandons the wild moors of Wuthering Heights, fervently wishing to reestablish himself as the wealthy gentleman he believes Cathy seeks. Having been successful in his ventures, he later returns to the adoptive family who raised him and hungrily seeks to punish those who once rejected him. </p> <p>In an exclusive introduction written for this edition by Ann Dinsdale, Chief Curator of the Bronte Museum, discover how critical and public opinion of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> has changed over time. </p> <p><b>About the author</b> </p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Emily is said to have had the most unusual character of all the Brontë sisters. A reserved character with few close acquaintances outside her family circle, Emily's dark and passionate nature is clearly reflected in her tale. Having been the consummate lover of animals and nature, in this book she also set out to paint an unforgettable picture of the stark and imposing moors that she so enjoyed walking along. </p> <p>Having developed a highly intelligent writing style, Emily ensures that the listener is emotionally involved throughout and often even a little horrified at the events that take place. A true work of art, <i>Wuthering Heights</i> surpasses expectation with its Gothic love scenes and desolate landscapes. Emily Brontë's only published work, it stands alone and will forever imprint itself upon the listener's memory. </p> <p><b>About the narrator</b> </p> <p>Joanne Froggatt is an English stage, film and television actress who shot to fame after her engaging portrayal of <i>Downton Abbey</i>'s Anna Bates. Also celebrated for her roles in <i>Dinnerladies</i>, <i>A Street Cat Named Bob</i>, <i>Murder in the Outback</i> and <i>Liar</i>, Joanne has now been acting for over 20 years and brings a wealth of expertise to her narratives. Having voiced an <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> series as well as Audible's 2017 Thriller of the Year, <i>Silent Child</i>, Joanne succeeds once more in delivering an incredibly engaging performance in this unique and exquisite adaptation of Emily Brontë's <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. </p>";
