window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Rock band Wanderlust is about to hit it big, guitarist Dave Kendall is sure of that. They're playing better venues, in front of bigger crowds - and the people showing up at the after parties are increasingly good-looking and cool. Some even radiate power, like \"Master\" Jeffries, the tall, saturnine man who seems to have some sort of weird control over Dave's fellow bandmates. </p> <p>But Dave's too tired to pay much attention to Jeffries. He's tired a lot lately, and making music isn't as much fun as it used to be. Probably he's just working - and partying - too hard. </p> <p>Luckily, Dave has a friend who takes what's happening to him very seriously. Diana Tregarde is a practicing witch and a Guardian of the Earth. It's her job to keep an eye on innocents like Dave and make sure they stay out of trouble and don't become someone's lunch. </p> <p>Jeffries has been on Diana's hit list since she first spotted him pursuing a young Romany. Di wasn't fast enough to stop him, but the Rom have their own protector - a dashing, charming, very attractive vampire named Andre Le Brel. </p> <p>Together, the witch and the vampire face Jeffries and his evil minions in a battle for the soul of rock 'n' roll.</p>";
