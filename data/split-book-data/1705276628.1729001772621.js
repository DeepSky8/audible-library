window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Two Alliance-Union novels, <i>Merchanter's Luck</i> and <i>Forty Thousand in Gehenna</i>, bound in one omnibus volume for the first time!</p> <p><i>Merchanter's Luck</i></p> <p>His name was Sandor, and he was the owner and entire crew of a tramp star-freighter that flew the Union planets under false papers and fake names. Her name was Allison, and she was a proud but junior member of the powerful family whose mighty starship, <i>Dublin Again</i>, was the true queen of the spaceways. They met at Viking Station. She seeking a night's dalliance; he desperately in search of a spacer assistant. Their fateful meeting was to lead to a record-breaking race to Pell Station, thereby catching the calculating eye of the grim commander of the Alliance battlecraft <i>Norway</i> and a terrifying showdown at a deadly destination off the cosmic charts.</p> <p><i>Forty Thousand in Gehenna</i></p> <p>When 40,000 human colonists are abandoned for political reasons on a planet called Gehenna, and re-supply ships fail to arrive, collapse seems imminent. Yet over the next two centuries, the descendants of the original colonists survive despite all odds by entering a partnership with the planet's native intelligence - the lizard-like, burrowing calibans.</p>";
