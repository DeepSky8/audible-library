It's easy to blame the death watch beetle, but is someone more sinister trying to frame the wood-boring insects for murder?</p> <p><i>Popcorn and Poltergeists</i> takes Lucy and Rafe to a college library where strange things are happening. A poltergeist is throwing fits, but is the obstreperous spirit a killer? Or are the ghostly temper-tantrums a warning?</p>";
