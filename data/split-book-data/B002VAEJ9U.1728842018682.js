window.bookSummaryJSON = "A predecessor to such monumental works such as <i>Crime and Punishment</i> and <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>, <i>Notes From Underground</i> represents a turning point in Dostoyevsky's writing towards the more political side. <p>In this work, we follow the unnamed narrator of the story, who, disillusioned by the oppression and corruption of the society in which he lives, withdraws from that society into the underground. A dark and politically charged novel, <i>Notes From Underground</i> is Dostoyevsky at his best.</p>";
