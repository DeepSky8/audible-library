window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A large country mansion. A locked room. A gruesome murder. </p> <p>Russian oligarch Alexander Volkov has invited 1,000 guests to a party at his palatial Surrey residence, Westgrave Hall. But while giving a private tour of the library, a gunman kills Volkov, wounding his ex-wife and slaying her new beau. Nothing makes sense to DCI Craig Gillard. In the blood-spattered crime scene there are no forensic traces of anyone else involved, CCTV shows no one entered or left the library, and everyone seems to have an alibi. Is it a crime of revenge, the squaring of a love triangle, or a Russian government operation? Could the victims have simply shot each other? Gillardâ€™s eventual discovery is shocking even to him. </p> <p>A gripping crime thriller from a master of the genre, <i>The Bodies at Westgrave </i>Hall will leave you guessing until the very end.</p>";
