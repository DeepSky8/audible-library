window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A startling encounter on a New York subway platform leads two strangers to a run-down tenement where a life or death decision must be made.</p> <p>In that small apartment, Black and White, as the two men are known, begin a conversation that leads each back through his own history, mining the origins of two fundamentally opposing world views. White is a professor whose seemingly enviable existence of relative ease has left him nonetheless in despair. Black, an ex-con and ex-addict, is the more hopeful of the men, though he is just as desperate to convince White of the power of faith as White is desperate to deny it. Their aim is no less than this: to discover the meaning of life.</p> <p>Deft, spare, and full of artful tension, <i>The Sunset Limited</i> is a beautifully crafted, consistently thought-provoking, and deceptively intimate work by one of the most insightful writers of our time.</p>";
