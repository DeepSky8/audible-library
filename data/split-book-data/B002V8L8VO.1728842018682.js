window.bookSummaryJSON = "The most perfect of Jane Austen's perfect novels begins with 21-year-old Emma Woodhouse comfortably dominating the social order in the village of Highbury, convinced that she has both the understanding and the right to manage other people's lives - for their own good, of course. <p>Her well-meant interfering centers on the aloof Jane Fairfax, the dangerously attractive Frank Churchill, the foolish if appealing Harriet Smith, and the ambitious young vicar Mr. Elton - and ends with her complacency shattered, her mind awakened to some of life's more intractable dilemmas, and her happiness assured.</p> <p>Austen's comic imagination was so deft and beautifully fluent that she could use it to probe the deepest human ironies while setting before us a dazzling gallery of characters - some pretentious or ridiculous, some admirable and moving, all utterly true.</p>";
