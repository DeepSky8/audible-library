window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Brought to you by Penguin.</b></p> <p>The audiobook of <i>Jingo</i> is narrated by impressionist and actor Jon Culshaw, best known for BBC Radio 4’s <i>Dead Ringers</i>, and for the Doctor Who audiobooks and dramas. BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>; <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>; <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (<i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i>; <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.</p> <p><b>'IT WAS SO MUCH EASIER TO BLAME IT ON </b><b><i>THEM</i></b><b>. IT WAS BLEAKLY DEPRESSING TO THINK THAT </b><b><i>THEY </i></b><b>WERE </b><b><i>US</i></b><b>.'</b><br> <br> War is brewing on the Discworld.<br> <br> An island has appeared from the ocean depths, right in the middle of the sea which separates the proud empires of Klatch and Ankh-Morpork. Of course, no one would dream of starting a war with the neighbours without a perfectly good reason… such as a 'strategic' piece of old rock, for instance.<br> <br> But when a Klatchian Prince is almost assassinated, peace talks break down and violent nationalism begins to spread. Ankh-Morpork prepares to fight. Only thing is, they don't have an army. Or much in the way of weapons.<br> <br> Commander Sam Vimes and the 'officially disbanded' City Watch get caught up in a deadly political game where the enemy appears to be on both sides and no one will listen to reason.<br> <br> And if they don't stop this absurd war, no one will…</p> <p><i>Jingo</i><b><i> </i></b>is the fourth book in the City Watch series, but you can listen to the Discworld novels in any order.</p> <p>The first book in the Discworld series - <i>The Colour of Magic</i> - was published in 1983. Some elements of the Discworld universe may reflect this.</p>";
