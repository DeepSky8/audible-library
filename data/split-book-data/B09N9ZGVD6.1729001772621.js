window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Straight out of the West (or, you know, somewhere through a gloom portal), in a thunder of hooves (but they're kinda like giant turtle hooves, if you can picture it?), comes Montana Coggeshall, gun (sword) slinger.</p> <p>Sure, he's survived Fiends' Night and an all-out goblin war. But for his people in Coggeshall to truly be safe, Montana needs to go out and find the source of all these crazy attacks.</p> <p>Along the way, Montana will be tested by feuding families, money-hungry miners, hookers with hearts of gold, and more than a few idiot tour guides. Turns out everything Montana's been through up until now wasn't hell. It was practice.</p> <p><i>Wild Wild Quest</i> is rabble rousin' LitRPG like you've never heard before. For fans of genre-twisting plots full of mind-bending battles.</p>";
