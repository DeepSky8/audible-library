window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Inspired by <i>The Hobbit</i> and begun in 1937, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> is a trilogy that J.R.R. Tolkien created to provide \"the necessary background of history for Elvish tongues\". From these academic aspirations was born one of the most popular and imaginative works in English literature. </p> <p><i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>, the first volume in the trilogy, tells of the fateful power of the One Ring. It begins a magnificent tale of adventure that will plunge the members of the Fellowship of the Ring into a perilous quest and set the stage for the ultimate clash between the powers of good and evil. </p> <p>In this splendid, unabridged audio production of Tolkien's great work, all the inhabitants of a magical universe – hobbits, elves, and wizards – step colorfully into life. Rob Inglis' narration has been praised as a masterpiece of audio.</p> <p></p>";
