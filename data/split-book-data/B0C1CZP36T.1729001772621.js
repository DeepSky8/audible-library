Whispers of a big job have reached the Met's Flying Squad. Something is going to be stolen, and soon. Something worth 500m.</p> <p>But what? And where? And how does it relate to the body under the overpass? It should be a simple case: stop the burglary, crack the gang, find the murderer—but for Gillard, once again it's personal…</p> <p>Fast-paced and utterly unputdownable, the next installment of the DCI Gillard series is perfect for fans of Robert Bryndza, Stuart Macbride and Faith Martin.</p>";
