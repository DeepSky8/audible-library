window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Amazing! One of the twistiest time-tales I've ever read...\"—Diana Gabaldon </p> <p>\"Crichtonesque thrillers don't come much better than this intricate outing which combines a fantastic premise... with a closed-circle whodunit. Readers won't be able to turn the pages fast enough.\"—Publishers Weekly—Starred Review </p> <p>From the worldwide bestselling author of The Extinction Trials, Departure, and The Atlantis Gene comes a new kind of sci-fi thriller: a time-travel murder mystery with a twist you'll never see coming. </p> <p>Control the Past. Save the Future. </p> <p>Dr. Sam Anderson is one of the most celebrated scientists in history. Ten years ago, he invented a device that changed the world forever. Now his life is about to be ripped apart—and his own creation may be to blame. </p> <p>One fateful morning, Sam discovers that his girlfriend has been murdered and that his daughter is accused of the crime. </p> <p>Sam believes she's innocent, but he can't prove it. There's only one thing he can do to save his daughter: confess to the crime. And so he does. </p> <p>But in the future, murderers aren't sent to prison. They're sent to the past. </p> <p>Thanks to Sam's invention–Absolom–the world's worst criminals are exiled forever, sent back to the time of the dinosaurs, where they live out their lives alone. </p> <p>As Sam steps into the Absolom chamber to leave for the Late Triassic, he makes a promise: he will get back to his family, clear his name, and find the person who killed the woman he loved. </p> <p>What Sam doesn't know is that there's a secret waiting for him in the past. And it might be his only hope of saving himself and his family. </p> <p>Sam isn't the only one seeking justice. In the present, his daughter, Adeline, also embarks on a mission to find the person who framed her and tore her family apart. She's already lost her mother. She can't bear losing her father too. </p> <p>As Adeline peels back the layers of the conspiracy against her family, she uncovers more questions than answers. Everyone around her is hiding a secret, including her legal guardian. And some people aren't what they seem. </p> <p>Adeline soon finds herself in the midst of a mystery that stretches across the past, present, and future—and leads to a revelation that will change everything. </p> <p>Lost in Time is more than a murder mystery about advanced technology and time travel. It's a heartwarming story about family and the lengths we might go to in order to save the ones we love—with a twist that will have you questioning everything you thought you knew since the first moment.</p>";
