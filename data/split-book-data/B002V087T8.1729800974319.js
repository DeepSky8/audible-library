window.bookSummaryJSON = "When Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables send for a boy orphan to help them out at their farm, they mistakenly get Anne Shirley, a feisty, independent but warm-hearted 11-year-old girl. Fortunately her sunny nature and quirky imagination win the hearts of her reluctant foster parents and everyone in the community. But not a day goes by without some memorable adventure or prank in the tragicomedy of her life. Early on she accidentally dyes her \"cursed\" red hair green. Later, in an effort to impress a neighbor, she bakes a cake, but with liniment instead of vanilla. <p>Lucy wrote that Anne is an extension of herself and represents the independent, \"new\" woman of the emerging 20th century. Individualistic, resourceful, and of a great humanitarian heart, she remains a great role model for girls and women today.</p>";
