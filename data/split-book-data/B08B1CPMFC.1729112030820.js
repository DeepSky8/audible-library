window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Immerse yourself in a guided breathwork exercise that leads you into a detailed body scan over music featuring chimes, an ocean drum, and the harmonium-like shruti. The experience creates the ideal blend of focus and relaxation to help you become more centered and calm at the end of the day. </p> <p>Jesse Israel was a successful music executive running his own label when debilitating anxiety and panic attacks forced him to step back and seek help. When he found meditation, it inspired him to switch gears in a big way. He founded The Big Quiet, a mass meditation movement that gathers thousands of people for large-scale moments of quiet around the world (including for Oprah’s 2020 Vision Tour with WW). Jackie Cantwell, who joins him in guiding this meditation, is the director of Medi Club and musician for The Big Quiet. </p> <p>Guided by leading experts and personalities in wellness, sleep meditations are brief listens focused specifically on helping you decompress before bed. They don’t require any previous experience — they're easy to get into and designed to help you take a moment at day’s end to just relax. </p> <p>This title is part of The Audible Sleep Collection, exclusive audio experiences created to help you fall asleep, stay asleep, and wake up in the right morning mindset. New and free for members. </p> <p>Jenavieve Varga: Violin </p> <p>Jackie Cantwell: Shruti, crystal bowls, ocean drum</p> <p>Topu Lyo: Cello </p>";
