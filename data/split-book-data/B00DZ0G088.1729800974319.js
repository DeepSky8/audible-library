A legend in the making.<br> <br> Hadrian Blackwater, a warrior with nothing to fight for, is paired with Royce Melborn, a thieving assassin with nothing to lose. Hired by an old wizard, they must steal a treasure that no one can reach.

But it isn’t gold or jewels that the wizard is after, and if he can just keep them from killing each other, they just might succeed.</p>";
