window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Professors Cook and Herzman provide you with an illuminating introduction to one of the greatest works ever written. One of the most profound and satisfying of all poems, The <i>Divine Comedy</i> (or <i>Commedia</i>) of Dante Alighieri is a book for life. In a brilliantly constructed narrative of his imaginary guided pilgrimage through the three realms of the Christian afterlife, Dante accomplished a literary task of astonishing complexity. </p> <p>But the full achievement of the <i>Commedia</i> goes beyond anything merely literary. In these twenty-four lectures, as you follow Dante on his journey, you'll learn how medieval literature offers insights into fundamental questions: What is the quality of our moral actions? How does spiritual transformation come about? What is the nature of good and evil, virtue and vice, sin and sanctity? Why is the world so full of strife? How do we go on when we lose the things we love? You'll discover why, in the centuries since the Commedia was written, not one of these questions has lost its force. Moreover, you'll hear Dante address them in a demanding and innovative Italian verse form (terza rima) that makes the <i>Commedia</i> one of the great virtuoso pieces of world literature. </p> <p>With the guidance of these two master professors, you'll learn invaluable background information on Dante's life and times; why Dante wrote the <i>Commedia</i>; how to approach the various English editions available; and how each part of the poem is connected to what has come before. But above all, you'll understand why the <i>Commedia</i> is not a puzzle to be solved or a book to be read and put aside-but a mystery whose beauty and richness is to be constantly savored.</p>";
