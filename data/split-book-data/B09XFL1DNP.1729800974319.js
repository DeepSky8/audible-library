window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>War is building. Blood is spilling. And the gods are not pleased.</p> <p>Casia has survived her brother's attempts to crush her and her growing army, but the battle for their empire is just beginning. Bitter and wounded, carrying the curse of a dark and dangerous upper-god, and desperate for more allies, she charges northward to seek the elves who once walked alongside the divine beings.</p> <p>The elven Court of Moreth holds knowledge. Secrets. And power. The kind of power that could shift all of Casia's wars in her favor. If she can survive the dangerous politics and treacherous magic of the elf-kind.</p> <p>While these outer battles rage, so too do the ones within. Elander is losing what remained of his divinity. His court. His powers. His grasp on what he once was and what he once knew. But he's determined to keep fighting, gathering his own ancient allies, and working to aid Casia in her wars. He lost her once. He won't do it again.</p> <p>But his devotion to her may be the very thing that destroys him.</p> <p>And when that destruction comes, it comes with a twist—one that could change their entire world.</p> <p>Forever.</p>";
