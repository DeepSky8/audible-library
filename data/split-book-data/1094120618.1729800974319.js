window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Lucy Maud Montgomery, the Canadian author of the popular Anne of Green Gables series, introduces us to an endearing new heroine in<i> Emily of New Moon</i>. Like Anne Shirley, Emily Starr is a quick-witted and imaginative orphan who is sent to live with her two maiden aunts at New Moon Farm after her father dies. Though initially disheartened by her strict and conventional Aunt Elizabeth, Emily slowly grows to love her new family and New Moon Farm.</p> <p>There she makes friends with Ilse Burnley, a tomboy with a blazing temper; quiet, artistic Teddy Kent; and Perry Miller, the hired boy, who Aunt Elizabeth looks down upon because he was born in the impoverished “Stovepipe Town”.</p> <p>Montgomery considered Emily to be a character much closer to her own personality than Anne, and some of the events which occur in the Emily series happened to Montgomery herself. Emily is described as having black hair, purply violet eyes, elfin ears, pale skin, and a unique and enchanting “slow” smile.</p> <p>This charming audio adaptation of <i>Emily of New Moon</i> is set against the backdrop of picturesque Prince Edward Island. A delightful story the whole family will enjoy! </p> <p><b>Originally published in 1923</b></p>";
