window.bookSummaryJSON = "<i>Paradise Lost</i> is considered to be the best epic poem in the English language, as John Milton seeks to \"justify the ways of God to men\" through relating the story of Satan's rebellion in Heaven, the deception and fall of Man, and the presaged event of Redemption through Jesus, the Son of God...the \"Second Adam.\" <p>An English cleric with a classical education, Milton lost his eyesight in 1652, and thus the story was largely dictated by the blind poet, lending a certain quality of the ancient oral epics, which only serves to enhance the telling of the tale. Weaving classical mythology with a deep knowledge and reference to Scripture, Milton's genius for narrative unfolds what his biographer, Samuel Johnson, called his \"peculiar power to astonish.\"</p>";
