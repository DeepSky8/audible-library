window.bookSummaryJSON = "The first thing every listener will want to know is whether Anne Shirley appears in these stories of Avonlea and Spencervale. She certainly does. As a matter of fact, page one starts off in this manner: \"Anne Shirley was curled up on the window seat of Theodora Dix's sitting room one Saturday evening, looking dreamily afar at some fair starland beyond the hills of sunset. Anne was visiting for a fortnight of her vacation.\" <p> However, most of the people who appear in this book are new to listeners of the Anne books. There are Ludovic and Theodora, \"Old Lady Lloyd\" and Sylvia Gray, Felix Moore and his grandfather, Little Jocelyn and Aunty Nan, Lucinda Penhallow, old Man Shaw's Blossom, Olivia Sterling, and many, many others.</p> <p> The charm of <i>Anne of Green Gables</i> and <i>Anne of Avonlea</i> is to be found on every page of this gently sentimental and enjoyably humorous book.</p>";
