The pirates, the Uldans, the Zatrathi - none of it mattered now. The final goal was so close. All they had to do was reach out and grasp it. </p> <p>Alas, fortune refuses to land in Surgeon's hand just like that, without a fight. Fortune only comes to those who can prove themselves. Will Alexis and Eunice find their inner strength and go to the end - or will the obstacles in their way force them to give up their search? After all, the most important thing is to find the planet with the prize. And yet faced with an entire galaxy, where do they even start?</p>";
