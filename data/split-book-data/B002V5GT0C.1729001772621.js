O'Brian received further attention with the critically acclaimed film adaptation, <i>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World</i>, which was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, and won two. </p> <p>When O'Brian passed away in 2000, he left behind three chapters of what was to be the 21st Aubrey-Maturin novel. The tale was to have followed Jack Aubrey in his new post, Rear Admiral of the Blue Squadron. </p> <p>Although it remains unfinished, <i>21</i> gives us one final glance at the unparalleled genius of a master craftsman and the series <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> hailed as \"the best historical novels ever written\". </p>";
