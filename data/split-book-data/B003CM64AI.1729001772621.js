window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Gary Leger thought life after college would bring great things. Instead, he's stuck in a dead-end job and finding that the real world isn't all it's cracked up to be. But when he walks into the woods behind his house one day, Gary finds a world beyond the \"real world\" - a realm of elves and dwarfs and witches and dragons. There he discovers that he is the only one who can wear the armor of the land's lost hero - and wield a magical spear. And if he doesn't, he can never go home again.</p>";
